					<div class="lab" onclick="location.href='cc.html';" style="cursor: pointer;">
						<h3>Creative Coding Lab</h3>
						<div class="overlay">
							<div class="overlay-text">A team of interdisciplinary researchers and artists focusing on applied research in interaction and visualization, as well as on the exploration of experimental and creative works based on current techniques in human-computer interaction, scientific and information visualization, graphics, computer vision, immersive environments, and machine learning.</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="lab">
						<h3>Design Reasoning Lab</h3>
						<div class="overlay">
							<div class="overlay-text">The Design Reasoning Lab considers applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in the design and development process for interactive media. This includes procedural content generation and machine playtesting. Additionally, the lab is developing a new generation of search engines that allow semantic search within the space of play for individual games as well as across many interactive media titles. </div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="lab">
						<h3>Expresssive Intelligence Studio</h3>
						<div class="overlay">
							<div class="overlay-text">A technical and cultural research group exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, art, and design. A major thrust of this work is advanced AI for interactive narrative and video games. This includes autonomous characters, story generation, automated asset creation, game data analysis, and intelligent support for media design.</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="lab">
						<h3>Human-Computer Interaction Lab</h3>
						<div class="overlay">
							<div class="overlay-text">The Human Computer Interaction Lab studies how technology is affecting fundamental aspects of our everyday lives, and uses insights from Cognitive and Social Science to design new digital tools to support memory and collaboration and to help manage personal information.</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="lab">
						<h3>Alternative Learning Technologies Lab</h3>
						<div class="overlay">
							<div class="overlay-text">An interdisciplinary team with projects ranging across Human-Computer Interaction, Learning Science, Electrical Engineering, Psychology, and Digital Arts. The mission of the lab is to create and explore the potential of alternative controllers, novel interfaces, and other forms of unique input/output.</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="lab">
						<h3>Social Emotional Technology Lab</h3>
						<div class="overlay">
							<div class="overlay-text">An interdisciplinary team with researchers from Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Psychology, and Digital Arts and New Media. The mission of the lab is to design, implement and study human computer interaction technologies that enhance physical, social, and emotional experiences.</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="lab">
						<h3>Software Introspection Lab</h3>
						<div class="overlay">
							<div class="overlay-text">The Software Introspection Laboratory focuses on the structure of software and how it evolves over time. As a lab, we're interested in how bugs get introduced into software and are working on techniques to identify and fix errors reliably.</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="lab">
						<h3>Tech4Good Lab</h3>
						<div class="overlay">
							<div class="overlay-text">The Tech4Good Lab does research in social computing, the intersection of computational systems and human interaction. We integrate design, modeling, and algorithms towards creating novel environments for the future of work, education, governance, and community engagement. We are currently focused on scaling situated and experiential learning, supporting job search and transitions, and supporting communities in collaborating around causes.</div>
